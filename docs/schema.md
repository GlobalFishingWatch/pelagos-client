# Tileset schema

The tileset schema consists of a stack of schemas:

* Tile binary file format (documented [here](https://github.com/SkyTruth/data-visualization-tools/blob/master/js/app/Data/TypedMatrixParser.js))
* The tileset URL structure
* The tileset header
  * The animation column mapper configuration
* The workspace specification
* The animation specific schemas
  * Configuration options for workspace file
  * Column schemas


A data source for an animation can either be a single tile file (given by its URL), or a tileset with header following the tileset URL structure, given as a base URL.

# The tileset URL structure
A tileset always has a header file under the base url:

    http://myproject.appspot.com/tile/mytileset/header

This file can the specify a set of new base url:s to use for tile fetches as well as track queries.

The base urls are specified as a list of fallback levels. For each level there can be multiple urls, used in a round-robin fashion. The client starts by trying to load a tile using the lowest fallback level. If a request returns a 404 error, the next higher fallback level is attempted, until all are exhausted.

This allows you to deploy a pre-generated set of tiles for low zoom levels to a static serving host, while dynamically filling in that set for the higher zoom levels.

# The tileset header
The tileset header specifies how to load tiles, and what columns to expect.

    {
      "tilesetName": "Default name for animation", 

      /* Urls to load tiles from. Each entry in the list is a fallback level (ordered from first level to attempt to last).
         Each level is a list of urls to try in a round-robin fashion.
      */

# The workspace secification
A workspace is a JSON file loadable from a URL. If the URL contains a query ?id=SOMEID, then the url without the query will be used to save new workspaces to using a POST request.
